# Predicting Diabetes with Neural Networks
This project aims to predict diabetes in individuals using a neural network model implemented in Python with the Keras library. The model leverages the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which includes critical features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more.

* Key Components:
  Neural Network Model: Implemented using the Keras library in Python.
  Dataset: Utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset for training and evaluation.
  Visualization: Visualizes key insights using Seaborn and matplotlib libraries.
  Evaluation: Assesses model performance and accuracy metrics.
